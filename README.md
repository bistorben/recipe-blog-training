# Responsive Food Blog Landing Page

This project is a responsive website designed to practice HTML, CSS (SCSS), and responsive design. As a reference, I used an existing food blog and recreated its layout to better understand modern web design principles.

## Features

- Flexible grid layout with media queries
- Hover animations and scaling effects
- Custom color and typography system using CSS variables
- Login and registration forms with checkbox validation
- Use of SCSS mixins for code reusability
